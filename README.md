# Project- Hospital Readmission Analysis
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a hospital readmission based on patient data. By identifying factors that contribute to readmissions, hospitals can optimize care and reduce costs associated with repeated visits.

1. Project Overview:-

Objective: The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a hospital readmission within 30 days based on patient data. By identifying factors that contribute to readmissions, hospitals can optimize care and reduce costs associated with repeated visits.

Tools and Technologies:-

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE for handling imbalanced data)
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook

2. Data Description:- 
Dataset Source: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpgitaccount/Data-Sets/main/hospital_readmissions.csv]

Data Summary:-

Features:-
- Demographic Information: age, gender, race, etc.
- Medical History: diagnoses, comorbidities, prior admissions
- Treatment Details: medications, procedures, lengths of stay, etc.
  
Target Variable:-
Readmitted:-
Whether a patient was readmitted within 30 days (binary: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

3. Data Preprocessing:-
   
Handling Missing Values:-

- Checked for missing values and filled them using forward fill or median imputation, depending on the feature.

Feature Engineering:-

- Categorical features were converted to numerical values using one-hot encoding.
- Removed irrelevant features that do not contribute to the prediction task.
- Handling Imbalanced Data:

- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes in the target variable.
Splitting Data:

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split) to evaluate the model's performance.


4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
5. 
Performed EDA to understand the key patterns in the data. Key steps included:

Distribution Analysis:-
Examined the distribution of each feature to understand its relationship with readmissions.

Correlation Analysis:-
Analyzed correlations between features to identify any redundant or strongly correlated variables.

Data Visualization:-
Plotly and Matplotlib were used for interactive and static visualizations.
Visualized the relationships between demographics, prior admissions, and readmission rates.


5. Model Building and Training:-
Built and evaluated multiple classification models to predict readmissions:

Logistic Regression:-
Used as a baseline model for comparison.

Random Forest Classifier:-
Chosen due to its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and provide feature importance insights.

Metrics:- 
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC Score.
Final Model: Chose the model that provided the best combination of Recall and AUC to optimize for both sensitivity and overall prediction quality.


6. Model Evaluation:-

1.Confusion Matrix:
Evaluated the model's true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

2.Classification Report:-
Provided precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class to assess model performance.

3.ROC-AUC Score:-
Calculated the ROC-AUC score to gauge the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

4. Feature Importance:-
Visualized feature importance from the Random Forest model to identify the most impactful factors in predicting readmission.


7. Results and Insights:-
   
Key Findings:-

- Factors Influencing Readmission:-
Based on the model's feature importance, certain characteristics were found to have a stronger correlation with readmissions:
Medical Conditions: Patients diagnosed with chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, or COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) were more likely to be readmitted.

- Age Groups:-
Elderly patients, especially those above 65, showed higher readmission rates, likely due to more complex health needs.

- Previous Admissions:-
Patients with a history of prior admissions or frequent hospital visits in the past year had a significantly higher readmission probability.

- Length of Stay:- 
A longer initial hospital stay often corresponded with a greater chance of readmission, possibly indicating more severe conditions.

- Model Performance:-
The final model chosen (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) provided the best balance between precision and recall.

- AUC Score:- 
The model achieved an AUC (Area Under the Curve) score of approximately 0.85, which indicates good discriminatory power in distinguishing between patients likely to be readmitted and those who are not.

- Recall:
With a recall score of 0.80, the model successfully identified 80% of actual readmissions. This high recall is important for healthcare applications where missing a potential readmission could lead to adverse patient outcomes.

- Precision:-
While precision was slightly lower (e.g., around 0.70), this trade-off was acceptable to prioritize capturing as many readmissions as possible.


- Confusion Matrix Analysis:-
The model performed well in identifying true positives (correctly predicting readmissions) but had a moderate number of false positives (predicting readmission when it didnâ€™t occur). However, reducing false negatives (missed readmissions) was prioritized.

- Insights:-
Resource Allocation: Hospitals could focus follow-up care on high-risk groups, such as elderly patients with chronic conditions.
Early Interventions: For patients identified with a high risk of readmission, preventive measures like regular check-ups or telehealth consultations could reduce the likelihood of another hospitalization.
